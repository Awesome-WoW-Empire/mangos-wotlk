## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 3.3.5.12340   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 3.3.5.12340   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- To report an exploit, it must contain the name of the exploit at a minimum
- To report a user exploiting, it must contain: name of the player, a timestamp, and a screenshot or video of the user exploiting
- To report a client vulnerability, it must contain as much information to repduce the exploit as possible
- To report a server crash, it must contain the steps to reproduce

You can expect a response to a security report 7-10 busniess days.  

Reports of a user exploiting may be rejected if there is not enough proof or information to discover the vulnerability or methods; this is the most likely result of reporting a user exploiting. Any other vulnerabilities will be accepted once a developer has proven the issue.  Not providing sufficient information may cause the issue to be rejected.

Once accepted, you may expect updates once a week.
